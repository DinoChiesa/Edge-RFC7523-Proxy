# Apigee Edge Proxy demonstrating RFC 7523 Token Exchange

This API Proxy bundle demonstrates token exchange - JWT for an opaque OAuth
token as decribed by [IETF RFC 7523](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523).

This is the token exchange process employed [by Google for service-to-service
invocation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount)
of various commercial APIs, such as Stackdriver, Drive, DLP, and so on.  [Google
Assistant](https://developers.google.com/actions/identity/oauth2-assertion-flow)
also uses this flow to obtain tokens from external systems.

This example shows you how you can implement this flow within your Apigee
organization, to facilitate integration with Google Assistant, or to allow other
third-party apps to authenticate securely.


## Disclaimer

This example is not an official Google product, nor is it part of an official
Google product. It's an example.


## Dependencies

The runtime for example depends on the JWT policies for Apigee Edge, which were
first available in Edge SaaS in January 2018.

The provisioning tool depends on the utilities {curl and openssl}, and also the
bash shell, and the Java-based tool JwtTool, which is included here. To build
the Java tool you need maven and JDK8.


## The jwt2token Proxy Endpoint

This endpoint performs the token exchange. The basepath is /rfc7523/jwt2token.

It accepts as input a POST /token

with a `x-www-form-urlencoded` payload that includes:

* grant_type = `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer`
* assertion = a JWT

The JWT must:
* be signed via RS256 using the public key belonging to the developer.
* have an expiry of no greater than 300s.
* have never been previously used to obtain a token.
* have the correct audience and scope and issuer (==consumer key).

If all these checks pass, then the proxy generates a client_credentials oauth
token and returns it. It has an expiry that you (the proxy designer) can specify
or alter.  This token can then be used like any other client credentials token
in Apigee Edge.

## Why?

One might ask: _Why exchange a JWT for an opaque token? Why not just use the JWT
for every service request?_

The reason to do token exchange is to allow fast server-side checking of
tokens. JWT are (a) large (512 bytes or more), and require time and space to
send over the networkm, and (b) computationally expensive to parse and verify,
because they use public/private key signatures. On the other hand, an opaque
OAuth token generated by Apigee Edge, is really easy and cheap for a client to
store and transmit (~28 bytes), and easy and cheap for Apigee Edge to verify.

Exchanging a JWT for an opaque token allows a faster token transmission, and
faster check of the token on the server side, during many many API requests.

This token exchange - a JWT identifying the service for an opaque oauth token -
is the pattern used by APIs for most public Google services.

You might also ask: _Why not just use a client-credentials grant, as described
in [the OAuth Standard (RFC 6749)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)?_

The reason to rely on a signed JWT in the beginning is to avoid sending secrets
across the network. A client_secret is a secret, and in OAuth Client Credentials
grant, the client must send that secret to the server. With the JWT bearer (RFC
7523) grant, the client does not transmit secrets. Instead it transmits a
digital signature which amounts to a proof of possession of the private key.


## The Token Exchange Logic

Here's how the thing works:
* There must be a developer entity registered in Edge
* There must be an API product in Apigee Edge
* There must be an app registered for the developer, authorized on the API Product
* The registered app must have a custom attribute named "public_key", and its contents must be the PEM/PKCS8 encoding of a public key. Delete the newlines prior to storing the PEM string, but include the beginning and ending stanzas (`-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----` and etc ).
* The client must generate a JWT, which is signed with the corresponding private key
* The app sends in the JWT to request an opaque token
* Apigee Edge checks the JWT, and issues the token if everything is valid

The check for validity involves:
* The issuer must be a valid API Key registered in Apigee Edge. Not expired nor revoked.
* The total lifetime of the JWT must be no longer than 5 minutes.
* The issued-at time must be valid. The not-before-time, if it exists, must be valid.
* The signature is correct.
* The JWT cannot have been used previously.  (Edge keeps a cache. )


## Provisioning the System

The good news is, there's a provisioning script that helps you create all the
things required as described above. To provision the proxy, the developer, the
product, and the app, and the associated keypair, run the provisioning script,
like so:

```
tools/provisionKeysProxyProductDeveloperAndApp.sh  -o ${ORG}  -e ${ENV}
```

Specify your organization name and environment name as appropriate.

The output will finish and emit a message like this:

```
private key file: private-pkcs8-20161214-201107.pem
public key file: public-20161214-201107.pem

consumer key: ayBZRVAGlmG8BnbQ0YllkCywvi3Ko9wI
consumer secret: m9cdAYxXtu3m7Nde
```

It will create an RSA keypair, or re-use an existing keypair if there is a unique one. (Requires openssl)


If you want to skip import and deploy of the proxy, you can pass the `-S` option.

```
tools/provisionKeysProxyProductDeveloperAndApp.sh   -o ${ORG}  -e ${ENV} -S
```

The above will create a new app and upload a new public key.


## Generating the required JWT

1. First, build the Java tool that generates the JWT:

   ```
   cd tools/jwttool
   mvn clean install
   cd ../..
   ```

2. then, run the wrapper script to generate a JWT:

   ```
   tools/createJwt.sh -k PRIVATE_KEY_FILE  -i CONSUMER_KEY_HERE
   ```

The CONSUMER_KEY_HERE and the PRIVATE_KEY_FILE that you use here, must be the
values shown by the provisioning script.

You can then check the generated JWT like so:

```
tools/checkJwt.sh -k PUBLIC_KEY_FILE  -t TOKEN
```

You must pass the appropriate public key file and token here.


## Invoking the Proxy to Perform the Exchange

Use a command like this:

```
curl -X POST -H content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded \
  https://${ORG}-${ENV}.apigee.net/rfc7523/jwt2token/token \
 -d  "grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer&assertion=${JWT}"
```

You will need to insert the rather long JWT in the appropriate place.
Also insert your ORG and ENV as appropriate.


## Deleting the Provisioned artifacts from the System

To remove the developer, the product, and the app, the cache, and the proxy, run
the provisioning script with the -r option, like the following:

```
tools/provisionKeysProxyProductDeveloperAndApp.sh   -o ${ORG}  -e ${ENV} -r

```
